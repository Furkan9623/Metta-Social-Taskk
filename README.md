# Find Countries based on currency

 FrontEnd Deployed Link- https://metta-social-currency-find-9623.netlify.app/


`*`I've created a web application using React JS that allows users to find countries based on currency. The application comprises three main components:

`1` Form Component: Manages user input and triggers the currency search. <br>

`2` Card Component: Displays information about the countries found based on the entered currency. <br>

`3` Spinner Component: Provides visual feedback during data retrieval.

For design, I used CSS to ensure a visually appealing and responsive interface. The application features robust error handling, redirecting users to an error page with a clear message if they enter an incorrect or unsupported currency. Additionally, I implemented debouncing to optimize performance and prevent unnecessary API calls, ensuring a smoother user experience.

Feel free to explore the application, and if you have any feedback or encounter issues, let me know.

# Features
`1` Search Countries By Currency. <br>
`2` Debouncing Implement. <br>
`3` Error Handling.
`4` Pagination.
